In this project I create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels [CMD Challenge](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/a83_NOBEtXgFr1Yqej0HYA)
Used the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move local screenshots to the sandbox environment.
To performed the file transfer using SFTP;
Here are the steps to follow:

Take the screenshots of the completed levels.
Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.

Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.
